generate code for a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow file named cicd.yml that runs on every push to the main branch. The workflow should include the following steps:
```yamlname: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main    
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3 
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to Production
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to production..."
          # Add your deployment commands here
